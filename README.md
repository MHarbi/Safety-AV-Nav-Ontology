Ontology for Safety of Navigation Sensors in Autonomous Vehicles

Understanding and handling uncertainties associated with navigation sensors in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is vital to enhancing their safety and reliability. Given the unpredictable nature of real-world driving environments, accurate interpretation and management of such uncertainties can significantly improve navigation decision-making in AVs. This paper proposes a novel semantic model (ontology) for navigation sensors and their interactions in AVs, focusing specifically on sensor uncertainties. At the heart of this new ontology is understanding the sources of sensor uncertainties within specific environments. The ultimate goal of the proposed ontology is to standardize knowledge of AV navigation systems for the purpose of alleviating safety concerns that stand in the way of widespread AV adoption. The proposed ontology was evaluated with scenarios to demonstrate its functionality.
